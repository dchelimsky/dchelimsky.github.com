<div class="entry-content"><h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Myron Marston is taking over leadership of the RSpec project, and will
be the lead maintainer of the rspec-core, rspec-expectations, and
rspec-mocks gems.</p>

<p>Andy Lindeman is taking over as lead maintainer of the rspec-rails gem.</p>

<h3>Myron Marston is RSpec&rsquo;s new project lead</h3>

<p>Myron Marston has been contributing to RSpec since the ramp up to the
2.0 release in 2010, and joined the core team in early 2011. In addition
to solid contributions to the code base, Myron has taken responsibility
for many bug reports, feature requests, pull requests, etc. He also
makes a habit of answering RSpec-related questions on Stack Overflow and
Twitter, and he does this all with thoughtfulness, patience, and
wisdom.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better choice to lead the RSpec project, so I invited
him to do so. Thankfully, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/">SEOmoz</a>, Myron&rsquo;s
employer, is allowing him to work on RSpec during work hours, and so he
accepted.</p>

<p>In addition to the overall project lead, Myron will be the lead
maintainer of the rspec-core, rspec-expectations, and rspec-mocks
gems. While Myron uses these core rspec libs every day for his work,
he doesn&rsquo;t do much with Rails, so we discussed and agreed that we&rsquo;d ask
somebody else to take care of the rspec-rails gem. Enter Andy Lindeman.</p>

<h3>Andy Lindeman is the new lead maintainer of rspec-rails</h3>

<p>Andy Lindeman is the newest addition to the rspec core team. Like Myron,
Andy takes great care in shepherding pull requests and answering
questions in addition to making his own rock solid contributions.  Andy
also writes Rails apps and does Rails training at
<a href="http://bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, which puts him in a great
position to ensure that rspec-rails keeps up with changes in Rails
remains a great choice for developing Rails apps.</p>

<p>Thanks in part to <a href="http://bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> for their
support of Andy&rsquo;s work on RSpec, Andy has agreed to take the lead on
rspec-rails.</p>

<h3>As for me &hellip;</h3>

<p>When Dave Astels introduced Steven Baker&rsquo;s new RSpec library to me back
in 2005, I started submitting patches, Steven gave me commit rights and,
a year later, he decided to move on to other work and offered me
leadership of the project.  I was overjoyed to accept.</p>

<p>In those days, I was teaching TDD/Refactoring courses for Object
Mentor. I was encouraged to work on OSS in my bench time, and I was
particularly interested in tools that helped to promote the
documentation and design aspects of TDD. RSpec and some of the early
definitions/discussions of BDD (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all behavior!&rdquo;) fit perfectly into
my thinking and my world.</p>

<p>After I left Object Mentor, RSpec was part of my day to day work on Ruby
applications, but most of my work on its maintenance moved to my spare
time. This was fine at first, as I had the support of employers and
family, but I found myself doing less and less of pretty much everything
else that I enjoy and learn from.</p>

<p>Back in June, I joined a project team at DRW Trading that deals in a lot
of Clojure and almost no Ruby.  In the roughly 6 months since, I&rsquo;ve been
learning a new domain, a new language, new programming models, and even
a new text editor. I consider myself extraordinarily fortunate to be
able to learn all of these new things, but I&rsquo;ve found myself less and
less able to balance my work on RSpec with my job and with everything
else I want to do.</p>

<p>And so, it is time.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ll continue to contribute to the project and surrounding
conversation, and I look forward to seeing all my friends in the
community at assorted conferences in the coming year(s). I&rsquo;ll just
be arriving without my RSpec Lead hat on.</p>

<p>Thank you to Steven Baker for handing me the wheel, and thank you to
everybody who has participated in the project and all RSpec users for
your support over these 6+ years. It&rsquo;s been a great honor and a great
pleasure.</p>
