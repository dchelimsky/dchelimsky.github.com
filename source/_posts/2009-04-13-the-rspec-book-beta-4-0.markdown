We've released version 4.0 of [The RSpec Book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) beta. It's got a number of improvements per [suggestions submitted by readers](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/errata), as well as two exciting new chapters.

#### New Chapter: Rails Controllers

Continuing inward on our outside-in journey, this chapter explores how (and _when_) to write controller specs. We also introduce approaches to dealing with some controller-specific spec'ing challenges like filters, global behaviour defined in application controller and sending email.

#### New Chapter: Extending RSpec

This chapter introduces techniques for extending RSpec to cater to domain-specific needs. Covered topics include custom example group classes, custom matchers (including an exciting new [matcher definition DSL](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/blob/master/features/matchers/define_matcher.feature)), macros and custom formatters. Whether customizing RSpec for your own app, or in order to ship domain-specific spec'ing extensions with the libraries you're releasing, this chapter is filled with really useful information that will help you make your specs easier to write _and_ read.

#### Thanks (again, and again, and again)

Many thanks to all of you who are already participating in [The RSpec Book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) beta program and making so many great suggestions. Your ongoing contribution to this process remains invaluable for the book and all of its readers.
