### rspec-core-2.6.0

[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0)

* Enhancements
  * `shared_context` (Damian Nurzynski)
      * extend groups matching specific metadata with:
          * method definitions
          * subject declarations
          * let/let! declarations
          * etc (anything you can do in a group)
  * `its([:key])` works for any subject with #[]. (Peter Jaros)
  * `treat_symbols_as_metadata_keys_with_true_values` (Myron Marston)
  * Print a deprecation warning when you configure RSpec after defining
    an example.  All configuration should happen before any examples are
    defined. (Myron Marston)
  * Pass the exit status of a DRb run to the invoking process. This causes
    specs run via DRb to not just return true or false. (Ilkka Laukkanen)
  * Refactoring of `ConfigurationOptions#parse_options` (Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas)
  * Report excluded filters in runner output (tip from andyl)
  * Clean up messages for filters/tags.
  * Restore --pattern/-P command line option from rspec-1
  * Support false as well as true in config.full_backtrace= (Andreas Tolf Tolfsen)

* Bug fixes
  * Don't stumble over an exception without a message (Hans Hasselberg)
  * Remove non-ascii characters from comments that were choking rcov (Geoffrey
    Byers)
  * Fixed backtrace so it doesn't include lines from before the autorun at_exit
    hook (Myron Marston)
  * Include RSpec::Matchers when first example group is defined, rather
    than just before running the examples.  This works around an obscure
    bug in ruby 1.9 that can cause infinite recursion. (Myron Marston)
  * Don't send `example_group_[started|finished]` to formatters for empty groups.
  * Get specs passing on jruby (Sidu Ponnappa)
  * Fix bug where mixing nested groups and outer-level examples gave
    unpredictable :line_number behavior (Artur Ma≈Çecki)
  * Regexp.escape the argument to --example (tip from Elliot Winkler)
  * Correctly pass/fail pending block with message expectations
  * CommandLine returns exit status (0/1) instead of true/false
  * Create path to formatter output file if it doesn't exist (marekj).

### rspec-expectations-2.6.0

[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0)

* Enhancments
  * `change` matcher accepts Regexps (Robert Davis)
  * better descriptions for have_xxx matchers (Magnus Bergmark)
  * range.should cover(*values) (Anders Furseth)

* Bug fixes
  * Removed non-ascii characters that were choking rcov (Geoffrey Byers)
  * change matcher dups arrays and hashes so their before/after states can be
    compared correctly.
  * Fix the order of inclusion of RSpec::Matchers in
    Test::Unit::TestCase and MiniTest::Unit::TestCase to prevent a
    SystemStackError (Myron Marston)

### rspec-mocks-2.6.0

[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0)

* Enhancements
  * Add support for `any_instance.stub` and `any_instance.should_receive` (Sidu
    Ponnappa and Andy Lindeman)

* Bug fixes
  * fix bug in which multiple chains with shared messages ending in hashes
    failed to return the correct value

* Enhancements
  * rails 3 shortcuts for routing specs (Joe Fiorini)
  * support nested resources in generators (Tim McEwan)
  * require 'rspec/rails/mocks' to use `mock_model` without requiring the whole
    rails framework
  * Update the controller spec generated by the rails scaffold generator:
    * Add documentation to the generated spec
    * Use `any_instance` to avoid stubbing finders
    * Use real objects instead of `mock_model`
  * Update capybara integration to work with capy 0.4 and 1.0.0.beta
  * Decorate paths passed to `[append|prepend]_view_paths` with empty templates
    unless rendering views. (Mark Turner)

* Bug fixes
  * fix typo in "rake spec:statsetup" (Curtis Schofield)
  * expose named routes in anonymous controller specs (Andy Lindeman)
