[The RSpec Book](http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) Beta 8.0 was just released. This release includes a number of fixed [errata](http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/errata) and one new chapter. Yes, only one chapter, but its a doozy:

This chapter introduces a random generator to the Codebreaker game. This brings up several issues that can add complexity to Cucumber scenarios, RSpec code examples, and the code we're driving out with the aid of these tools and the BDD process. We address these issues and offer strategies to manage the complexity they introduce.
