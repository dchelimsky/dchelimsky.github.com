[Yurii Rashkovskii](http://rashkovskii.com) has just released 0.1 of [RSpec Extensions](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rspec-ext/).






This is a really exciting thing to see as there are a LOT of good ideas about extending RSpec that we've been cautious about adding in an effort to keep things simple, focussed and general. Hats off to Yurii for taking it upon himself to get his ideas out to the rest of the community.






My hope is that, as rspec matures, more extension libraries like this will appear and that, as specific bits of functionality prove their usefulness in a general way, we'll be able to incorporate them into rspec down the road.
