I’m pleased to announce the beta release of the Pragmatic Bookshelf’s [The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber and Friends](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book)!

It’s been a long time coming, and there’s still a lot of work to do to get to print. The beta release has 9 of the 22 chapters we have planned. Most of what remains is almost done, but not quite ready to release yet. As with all of the Pragmatic beta books, we’ll do regular updates every few weeks as we wrap up the remaining chapters and incorporate your feedback. And please do provide feedback. We want this book to serve you well!

There are six authors involved: Dave Astels, Zach Dennis, Aslak Hellesøy, Bryan Helmkamp, Dan North, and me. I’m honored to be in such good company here, with the guys who brought us BDD, to the developers and maintainers of RSpec, Cucumber and Webrat.

You can read more (and buy the book!) at [http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book)

On behalf of all the authors, I’d like to extend a special thank you to all of you who have contributed to the software and the conversation around RSpec, Cucumber, and BDD in general. RSpec would be nothing without the community that has evolved around it, so thank you, thank you, thank you!
