I'm going to be presenting at [RailsConf 2008](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home) on [RSpec's](http://rspec.info) Story Runner. I'll be talking about how I approach writing for the Story Runner and address several related issues including:








  * plain text stories vs pure Ruby (when is which appropriate?)

  
  * extending the RailsStory with custom helpers

  
  * testing forms using [webrat](http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/webrat) within the Story Runner

  
  * finding a balance of domain and UI scenarios

  
  * duplication between stories/scenarios and model/view/controller/helper examples






That's probably already more than I can cover fairly in a 45 minute presentation, but feel free to make other suggestions if you have them.






See you in Portland!
