I'm going to be presenting at [ETEC](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/index.php) on [RSpec's](http://rspec.info) Story Runner. This will be more or less the same talk I'm [presenting at RailsConf](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2008/01/26/presenting-at-railsconf-2008) in May, except that it's in March and on the other coast.






See you in Philly!
