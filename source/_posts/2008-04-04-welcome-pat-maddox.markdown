I'm pleased to announce that [Pat Maddox](http://evang.eli.st/blog) is joining the [RSpec](rspec.info) Development Team.






As you may already know, Pat has been contributing great patches and actively participating on the [rspec-users](http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/rspec-users) and [rspec-devel](http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/rspec-devel) mailing lists for quite some time. He has demonstrated a deep understanding of Behaviour Driven Development in general, and specifically as it applies to Rails, which has certainly posed some of the more interesting questions on our mailing lists.






We are all excited to have Pat on board and look forward to his continued contribution.
