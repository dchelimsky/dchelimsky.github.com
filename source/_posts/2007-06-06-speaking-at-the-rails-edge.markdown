Mike Mangino of [Elevated Rails](http://elevatedrails.com) and I are joining forces to do a talk at [The Rails Edge](http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/) in Chicago in August. We'll be talking about how to use [RSpec](http://rspec.rubyforge.org) and [Selenium](http://www.openqa.org/selenium/) together to drive the development of Rails applications.






Hope to see you there!
