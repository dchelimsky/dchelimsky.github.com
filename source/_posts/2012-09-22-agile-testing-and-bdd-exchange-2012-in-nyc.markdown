I'm excited to be presenting on Behavior-Driven Objects at the Agile Testing & BDD eXchange in NYC on Monday, October 1st (details below). From the [conference website](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/david-chelimsky-talk-tbc):



> 
One of the original ideas behind BDD was that testing should be about behavior at all levels. Effectively, all automated tests can be viewed as "functional tests" of entry points, be they user facing or internal, crossing procedural boundaries or not. In this talk we'll explore approaches to focusing on the behavior of objects, using language that also serves to document the expected behavior in ways useful to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.




The Agile Testing & BDD eXchange is a one-day conference with talks, open-space discussions and focus on 'quality time' between presenters and attendees. There is a nice blend of technical talks like [Uncle Bob Martin talking about how to apply SOLID principles to test design](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/the-solid-principles-of-test-design), and more process oriented talks like [Ellen Gottesdiener's talk on product definition through structured conversation](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/ellen-gottesdiener-talk-tbc).
