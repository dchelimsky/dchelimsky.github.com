I'm pleased to report that I'm going to be presenting at [QCon London](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/conference/) in March. [Aslak Helles√∏y](http://aslakhellesoy.com), [Dr. Nic Williams](http://drnicacademy.com/who), [Kevin Clark](http://glu.ttono.us/) and I have been invited to present about various aspects of [The Rise of Ruby](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=90).






We'll also be running [tutorials on Monday](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/schedule/monday.jsp). Aslak and I will present [Ruby for Java and C# Programmers](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/presentation/Ruby+for+Java+%26+C%23+programmers) and Dr. Nic will present on [Rails](http://qcon.infoq.com/london/presentation/Rails).
