I'm thrilled to announce that [The RSpec Book](http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) has entered the production process!

For those of you unfamiliar with the publishing industry, as I was before this project, "has entered the production process" does _not_ mean that it's off to the printer. What it _does_ mean is that it is currently being indexed so readers will be able to find the stuff they're looking for. After indexing it will be copyedited (in which someone with better grammar and spelling than any of the authors possess makes the book more readable) and typeset, and _then_ off to the printer.

If all goes to plan (yes, there actually is a plan!), `books.should be\_on\_shelves` in late September, early October.

That light at the end of the tunnel is, finally, _not_ an oncoming train!
