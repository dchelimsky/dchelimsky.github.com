I'd like to welcome [Chad Humphries](http://spicycode.com) to the [Rspec](http://rspec.info) Development Team.

Chad wrote an Rspec-compatible framework named [Micronaut](http://github.com/spicycode/micronaut), which runs specs written for Rspec. With Chad on board, we're replacing Rspec's runner with Micronaut's runner for rspec-2.0, which is already in progress and should be released with a new rspec-rails-2.0 plugin/gem in time for the [Rails](http://github.com/rails) 3.0 release.

Check back here for more details over the coming days, but in the mean time:

#### Welcome, Chad!
