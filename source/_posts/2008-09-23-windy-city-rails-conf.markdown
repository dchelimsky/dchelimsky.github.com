This past weekend, I presented on BDD and RSpec at the first annual [Windy City Rails Conf](http://windycityrails.org/). As is typical, I ran out of time and didn't get to get down to details. My next talks are starting w/ code examples!






Until then, here are the [slides from the presentation](/assets/2008/9/23/BehaviourDrivenRails.WindyCityRails.2008.pdf).
