After a few months of exploring git and hosting [RSpec's](http://rspec.info) git repository at [github](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec), we're happy to announce that github is now RSpec's official home for Source Code Management.






Tracking will continue to live at the [lighthouse](http://rspec.lighthouseapp.com).






We will continue to release gems to [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rspec](Rubyforge), but we will no longer be committing changes to the subversion repository there. For Rails users who are using the rspec plugins for Rails, edge rails now supports git-hosted plugins.






We've broken the project up into four separate repositories:








  * [rspec](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wikis/home) for the rspec gem/plugin

  
  * [rspec-rails](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails/wikis/home) for the rspec-rails gem/plugin (formerly rspec_on_rails)

  
  * [rspec-tmbundle](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-tmbundle/wikis/home) for the TextMate bundle

  
  * [rspec-dev](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-dev/wikis/home) for developers/contributors






See the wikis for each repository for more information about building, installing and contributing to the project.
