[The RSpec Book](http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) Beta 6.0 was just released. This release includes a number of fixed [errata](http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/errata), two new chapters, and a bit of re-organization.

#### Hello
We added a new chapter with basic install instructions and basic Hello
Cucumber and Hello RSpec examples.

#### Rails Models
Covers writing model specs, validations, associations, mocks, test data
builders and more.

#### Automating Features with Cucumber
We split Describing Features with Cucumber into two chapters: Describing
Features with Cucumber and Automating Features with Cucumber. This allowed us
to expand the material on planning the first release and iteration in the
first chapter, and keep of the technical _in the trenches_ material
in the second.

Even if you've already read through the tutorial in previous beta releases,
you're going to want to re-read these two chapters.
