We finally released RSpec-0.9 today. We had a little trouble w/ 0.9.0, so we skipped ahead to 0.9.1.




To get the gem:

    
    gem install rspec



To install the Spec::Rails plugin:

    
    ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_1/rspec
    ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_1/rspec_on_rails





This release comprises myriad improvements and changes, some of which I've blogged about here, the rest of which you can [read about](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/changes.html) on the [rspec website](http://rspec.rubyforge.org).






Of special note is our growing list of [contributors](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/team.html). It is very exciting to be involved with a project that has such an active user group filled with imaginative people who have contributed some of RSpec's most exciting new features.






Thank you, thank you, thank you to all who participate whether it is through patches, feature requests, bug reports, or simply interacting on the mailing lists. You've all had an important impact on RSpec's growth.
